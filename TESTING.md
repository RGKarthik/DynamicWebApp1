# Testing the Quiz Website

## Issue Resolved
The error in showing questions was due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions when trying to fetch the `questions.json` file directly from the file system. This is a common browser security feature that blocks local file access via JavaScript.

## Solution Implemented
- Embedded all questions data directly into the `quiz.js` file
- Removed the `fetch()` call and async/await dependencies
- Added debugging console logs to help troubleshoot

## How to Test

### Method 1: Direct File Opening (Now Works!)
1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser by double-clicking it
2. Enter your name and select 2 topics
3. Click "Start Quiz"
4. The quiz should now work without errors

### Method 2: Using Debug Page
1. Open `debug.html` in your browser
2. Click through each test step to verify functionality
3. Use the "Go to Quiz Page" button to test the full flow

### Method 3: Local Server (Recommended for Development)
If you have Node.js installed:
```bash
cd "c:\Users\karrg\SGSGVibe\DynamicWebApp1\DynamicWebApp1"
npx serve .
# Or use any other local server
```

### Debugging Information
- Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
- Check the Console tab for debug messages
- The quiz now includes detailed logging for troubleshooting

## What Was Fixed
1. **CORS Issue**: Removed external JSON file dependency
2. **Async/Await Error**: Converted to synchronous code
3. **Questions Loading**: Embedded 220 questions directly in JavaScript
4. **Error Handling**: Added better debugging and error messages
